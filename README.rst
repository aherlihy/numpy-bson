==========
BSON-NumPy
==========

MongoDB, Inc. has stopped development of BSON-NumPy and this project has been superseded by
`PyMongoArrow <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongo-arrow/tree/main/bindings/python>`_. In addition
to NumPy arrays, **PyMongoArrow** also supports direct conversion of MongoDB query results to
Pandas DataFrames and Apache Arrow Tables, amongst other features. See the project
`documentation <https://mongo-arrow.readthedocs.io/>`_ to get started with **PyMongoArrow**.

:Info: See `the mongo site <http://www.mongodb.org>`_ for more information. See `GitHub <http://github.com/mongodb/bson-numpy>`_ for the latest source.

About
=====

A Python extension written in C that uses `libbson
<http://mongoc.org/libbson/current>`_ to convert between `NumPy <https://pypi.org/project/numpy/>`_
arrays and `BSON <http://bsonspec.org>`_, the native data format of MongoDB.

This project is a **prototype** and not ready for production use.
